# Frij 75477M
This repository contains our 75477M's code for the [2023-2024 Over Under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvDqEI7qO34) season of the VEX robotics competiton.

Having the code in a git remote allows us to collaborate as a team easily as everyone has access to the codebase and any changes can immidiately be reflected across all our devices. 

#### Programming
Frij's code uses purely Python. You can find the wiring guide at the top of main.py for the brain's port configuration.

#### Mechanical Subsystems
- 6-motor drivetrain at 366 RPM
- 2-motor puncher
- Pneumatics powered front wings
- Passive triball blocker
